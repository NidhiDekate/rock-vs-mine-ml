# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as **Rock** or **Mine** based on frequency response data.

## Dataset
- Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Each sample represents sonar signal returns bounced off either a rock or a metal cylinder (mine)

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train-test split with stratification
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using accuracy score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `rock_vs_mine.ipynb`
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Results
The model achieves reliable accuracy in distinguishing between Rock and Mine signals.
